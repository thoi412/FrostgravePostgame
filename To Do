Prompt to run through main again at end of main.
Need to bug check for the Staff of Casting.  Does it make only 1 set staff?  Probably...  Then how best to have 80 different staffs an option for 1 of the magic item rolls. More nested randomizers
Move data to a data file and leave main.py to just run the logic.
Type up potion descriptions.
Make this portable, either run it on a web page or on an Android App.

Profit??

Maybe make it useful in-game by adding the monster table rolls.
